Create Json Package:
  - within include FleetJson, MessageJson, ShipJson, CoordinatesJson, CoordJson, EndGameJson, JoinJson, MessageJson, 
    SetupJson records and JsonUtils class
  - These records will allow us to process messages that are given to our code through the server.
  - It specifies what information is in the arguments
Driver Class: main run method:
  - Changed the main method to check for how many arguments are in the command line; If there are no arguments run a 
    regular manual BattleSalvo game; If there are two arguments connect the client to the server given the host and 
    port arguments (if not possible throw an illegal argument exception)
  - Changed the main method to check for how many arguments are in the command line; If there are no arguments run a 
    regular manual BattleSalvo game; If there are two arguments connect the client to the server given the host and 
    port arguments (if not possible throw an illegal argument exception)
View: UserInput Class: Create a new method that asks a prompt and returns a string 
  - Originally hardcoded name into the BattleSalvo game, creating the new method would allow for us to ask the user for 
    a name as well as the game type that they want to play
Created ControlInt interface:
  - lifted the run method from BattleSalvo and ProxyDealer classes to created the ControlInt interface
Controller: BattleSalvo Class: split the run method into smaller methods 
  - Take apart the method by which part of the game that it handles (ie taking shots, returning damageâ€¦) Each part will
    have its own method that way when the server returns a message for the game it can be fed into the method that it 
    is specifically meant for
  - removed most code from the constructor and moved it into the run class
Abstracted Player Class:
  - lifted identical methods from AIPlayer and HumanPlayer classes into an abstract player class that implements the 
    player interface in order to clean up code
ProxyDealer:
  - created a ProxyDealer class that implements the ControlInt interface and handles JSON and server inputs/outputs
